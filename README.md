# Random Image Timer
This StreamElements custom widget can be used to visualize some sorts of content gamification (for example, every 20 minutes a new class focus).

Special thanks to [Laiyart](https://www.twitch.tv/laiyart) for the idea.


## Description of operation:
The widget randomly picks images from an image pool at predetermined time intervals and displays them.  
It has also options to limit said randomness to a certain degree.


## Chat command types:
 - `!img random` 
   
   Swaps the current image with a random one.
   
 - `!img n`

   The placeholder `n` can be a number between 1 and the total number of images in the pool.

   Pauses the timer.
   
 - `!img resume` 
   
   Unpauses the timer.
